add game title to definition data

add game properties to definition data

separate game state from game context / model

Game context as domain root

general refactoring to remove repeditive code

Object builders --> Constructors

split out into mvc

pull ui out of html and into js view

menues --> view

event reactions --> controller

context --> model

event reactions in the controller need to be altered to 
be more explicitely defined in the menu definition data

bring log statements into classes

"View Player" --> Sprite.toString

Item --> Artifact

Spell --> Skill

"View Item" --> Artifact.toString

"Read Spell" --> Skill.toString

Cast spell should take an enemy as a second param,
and contain all of the decision logic

Stats should be definable in data:
	one per each of [persist, attack, defend]
	other stats may be added as tallies to be used
		as cost for skills
