Attacks should have two possible results: success or failure

Items should have heft / weight, users are limited by capacity/strength/etc.

other stats may be given a contributory effect:
	altering the values of yet other stats through
	user-defined calculations

Skills should be 'learned' to bring them into a user's
	skill base.

Enemies should come with 'rewards'.

Items and Skills should be able to affect multiple stats, 
	both positively and negatively

Items used in battle should take damage;
	damage should reduce the power of an item.
	
Stats should also be able to be used comparatively:
	player has a speed of 10, enemy speed 5: 
		player gets 2 turns for enemy's 1
	enemy has agility 12, player has agility 10: 
		odds of enemy preventing player from running are 6/5
